Code Debt Collector
===================

A command line tool to collect code debt from source code.


Some other items that should be addressed are listed below:

- Need unit tests
- There is only 1 repository provider--SQL Server. Tested with SQL Server 2012. Decided not to use Entity Framework to keep as simple as possible. May wish to change.
